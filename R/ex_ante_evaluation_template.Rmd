# Introduction

This report was prepared for `r project_proponent` in `r print(format(Sys.Date(), "%B %Y"))`. It details 4C's evaluation of the areas put forward by `r project_proponent` in terms of their potential suitability for carbon finance. The report has 3 objectives:

1.  Describe the context of the proposed project areas in terms of their deforestation risk;
2.  Estimate ex-ante the anticipated additionality of the proposed projects;
3.  Discuss the implications of our results for carbon finance and the limitations to our method.

We cover these points in the specified order below.

# 1. The context of the proposed project

`r project_fullname` is located in `r country`. The project started in `r start_year` and has an area of `r format(project_area_ha, big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE, digits = 3)` hectares.


```{r echo=FALSE}

# ________________ FILL IN PROJECT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION __________________

# Replace this chunk with a short narrative about the context of the project and why it was chosen for evaluation by 4C. Include any other details relevant to the interpretation of this document.

```

The locations of the project area is shown below, both on the country-scale and project scale.

```{r plot_map, fig.cap="Location of the project area (red)"}

world <- fortify(map("worldHires", fill=TRUE, plot=FALSE))
country_map <- world %>% filter(region==country)

ggplot() + 
  geom_map(data=country_map,map=country_map,aes(x=long,y=lat,map_id=region),
           colour='black',fill='grey90',linewidth=1)+
  geom_sf(data=shapefile,fill='red',colour='red',inherit.aes=F)+
  coord_sf()+
  theme_void()+
  annotation_scale(text_cex=1.5,location='bl')

```

# 2. Deforestation context

Here we present deforestation data from [Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/) to describe the risk of deforestation at various scales related to the project.

```{r echo=FALSE}

# POTENTIALLY INCLUDE DATA FROM GFW HERE

```


Now focusing on within-project deforestation, we can use [JRC data](https://forobs.jrc.ec.europa.eu/TMF) to visualise specific instances of deforestation and degradation within the project areas. In the plots below, we show degradation (orange), deforestation (red) and reforestation (green) transitions in the project areas between 2011 and 2021.

\

```{r spatial_deforestation, out.width="50%"}

library(ggspatial)

counter <- 1

plot_transitions <- function(data,t0,period_length,shapefile){

# count number of 1s at project start
  
t0_index <- grep(paste0('luc_',t0),colnames(data))

data_filtered <- data[data[,t0_index]==1,]

no_1s <- data_filtered %>% nrow()

# identify where there have been changes

tend <- t0 + period_length

luc_t5 <- data_filtered %>% 
  select(paste0('luc_',tend))

response <- case_when(
  luc_t5==1 ~ 0,
  luc_t5==2 ~ 2,
  luc_t5==3 ~ 3,
  luc_t5==4 ~ 4,
  luc_t5>4 ~ 0)

data_filtered$response <- as.factor(response)

plot <- data_filtered %>% 
  filter(response != 0) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=lng,y=lat,colour=response))+
  geom_sf(data=shapefile,inherit.aes=F,fill='grey80',colour=NA)+
  geom_point(alpha=0.5)+
  scale_colour_manual(values=c('orange','red','green'),name='Transition',labels=c('Degradation','Deforestation','Reforestation'))+
  annotation_scale(text_cex = 1.3)+
  theme_void()+
  theme(legend.position='none')

return(plot)

}
  
plot <- plot_transitions(set_k,2011,10,shapefile)

# 3. Estimating anticipated additionality

### Methods

The approach used in the calculation of the baseline deforestation rate is based on pixel matching. This approach allows us to identify places which are similar to the project but are not protected. We can then measure deforestation in these places, which tells us how forest loss tends to progress in the absence of the project scenario. This information can be used as a baseline expectation.

The method for forecasting deforestation into the future was developed by our colleague [E-Ping Rau](https://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-e-ping-rau). It involves the following main steps:

1.  Take a **sample of pixels** from within the project boundary.
2.  Based on the characteristics of this sample, identify a set of **matching pixels** outside of the project.
3.  Filter the set of matching pixels to exclude those likely to have zero additionality.
4.  Calculate the **deforestation rate** across the set of matched pixels, and convert this to a carbon loss rate. This forms the baseline we use to calculate anticipated additionality.
5.  Calculate the likely additionality of the project under different mitigation scenarios.

The set of matched pixels was identified based on similarity to the project in terms of the following matching variables:

-   Inaccessibility (motorized travel time to healthcare)

-   Elevation

-   Slope

-   Previous deforestation

For more information on our matching variables see Appendix 1.

We can can examine the within-project variation in inaccessibility, elevation and slope:

```{r plot_vars_function}

plot_vars <- function(data,shapefile,variable_name){
  
  if(variable_name=='access'){
    
    variable_fullname <- 'Inaccesibility (mins)'
    low <- 'navyblue'
    mid <- 'blue1'
    high <- 'lightblue'
    
  } else if(variable_name=='elevation'){
    
    variable_fullname <- 'Elevation (m)'
    low <- 'darkgreen'
    mid <- 'green1'
    high <- 'lightgreen'
    
  } else if(variable_name=='slope'){
    
    variable_fullname <- bquote('Slope ('*degree*')')
    low <- 'brown'
    mid <- 'orange'
    high <- 'gold'
  }
  
  
  data <- data %>% select(lng,lat,variable_name) 
  
  limits <- c(min(data[,3]),max(data[,3]))
  midpoint <- 0.5*(limits[1]+limits[2])
  
  data %>% 
  ggplot(data=data,mapping=aes(x=lng,y=lat,colour=variable_name))+
  geom_sf(data=shapefile,inherit.aes=F,fill='grey80',colour=NA)+
  geom_point(size=2)+
  scale_colour_gradient2(name=variable_fullname,
                         limits=limits,
                         midpoint=midpoint,
                         low=low,
                         mid=mid,
                         high=high)+
  theme_void()
}

### Location of matched points

Here we show the locations of the matched points used to calculate additionality. The project is shown in red, and the matched points are shown in blue. For clarity, we have downsampled the set of matched points from 250,000 to 10,000, which is still a representative sample.

\

```{r match_location}

match_data <- set_m %>% sample_n(10000)
proj_data <- set_k

xmin <- filter(match_data) %>% select(lng) %>% min()
xmax <- filter(match_data) %>% select(lng) %>% max() 
ymin <- filter(match_data) %>% select(lat) %>% min()
ymax <- filter(match_data) %>% select(lat) %>% max()

base_map <- get_stadiamap(bbox=c(left=xmin,bottom=ymin,right=xmax,top=ymax),zoom=8,type='stamen_terrain_lines')

plot <- ggmap(base_map) +
geom_point(data=match_data,aes(x=lng,y=lat),alpha=0.5,inherit.aes = FALSE,colour='blue') + 
geom_point(data=proj_data,aes(x=lng,y=lat),alpha=0.1,inherit.aes = FALSE,colour='red') + 
coord_fixed()+
theme_void()+
theme(legend.position='none')+
ggtitle(project_list_neat[counter])

print(plot)
  

```

### Quality of the matched points

Here we show how well the matching points align with the project in terms of three key matching variables. Correspondence between the project (shown in red in the plots below) and the matched set (shown in blue) indicates that the baseline will be a sensible prediction of the business-as-usual scenario for places like the project.\

```{r match_quality}
  
proj_data <- set_k %>% 
  select(slope,elevation,access)
match_data <- set_m %>% 
  filter(exclude==F) %>% 
  select(slope,elevation,access) %>% 
  sample_n(10000)

cont_data <- rbind(proj_data,match_data) %>% 
  select(type,elevation,slope,access)

#cont_data[,5:length(cont_data)] <- 100*cont_data[,5:length(cont_data)]

# rename labels

#                                 'Slope',
#                                 'Forest~cover~t[-5]',
#                                 'Deforestation~t[-5]',
#                                 'Elevation',

# plot

cont_data <- melt(cont_data)
cont_data$variable <- factor(cont_data$variable,levels=c('access','elevation','slope'))
levels(cont_data$variable) <- c('Inaccessibility',
                                'Elevation',

### Results

Below we present the results of our ex-ante additionality forecast.

Additionality depends not only on baseline deforestation risk but the ability of the project to mitigate that deforestation. Therefore, we present the expected additionality under different mitigation scenarios (25% to 100% mitigation success).

The additionality is the **annual avoided carbon dioxide emissions, in tonnes per year**. One tonne of avoided CO2 emissions is equivalent to one carbon credit.

Note that we present the raw additionality, without accounting for leakage and impermenance (discussed later).

```{r deforestation_baseline}

library(stringi)
library(scales)

# rename

results <- results_data %>%
  mutate(`100% Mitigation` = mean_100 * project_area_filtered,
         `75% Mitigation` = mean_75 * project_area_filtered,
         `50% Mitigation` = mean_50 * project_area_filtered,
         `25% Mitigation` = mean_25 * project_area_filtered) %>%
  rename(`Area ID` = X) %>%
  select(-matches('mean|ci|project|filtered'))

results %>% mutate(across(where(is.numeric), comma))
  
```

We can visualise the results below for the 100% mitigation scenario.

```{r plot_summary, fig.height=6}

data_summary <- results_data %>% 
  mutate(mean_100_ha = mean_100 * project_area_filtered,
         ci_100_ha = ci_100 * project_area_filtered) %>% 
  select(X,mean_100_ha,ci_100_ha) %>% 
  mutate(lb=mean_100_ha-ci_100_ha,ub=mean_100_ha+ci_100_ha)

results_data[6,1] <- 'Tenharim do Igarape Preto'
data_summary[6,1] <- 'Tenharim do Igarape Preto'

plot <- results_data %>% 
  mutate(mean_100_ha = mean_100 * project_area_filtered,
         ci_100_ha = ci_100 * project_area_filtered) %>%
  select(X,mean_100_ha,ci_100_ha) %>% 
  melt() %>%
  ggplot(data=data,mapping=aes(y=value,x=X,fill=X))+
  geom_errorbar(data=data_summary,mapping=aes(x=X,colour=X,ymin=lb, ymax=ub),width=0.5,inherit.aes=F)+
  ylab('Annual carbon loss rate (tCO2/year)')+
  xlab('')+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(legend.title=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1),
        legend.position='none',
        text=element_text(size=16))

# 4. Implications and uncertainties

### Relevance to carbon finance

We do not anticipate a perfect match between the anticipated additionality and the actual additionality. However, the anticipated additionality gives an idea of the likely future deforestation risk in a particular project. A higher anticipated additionality indicates a higher risk, and hence higher potential additionality - should this deforestation be mitigated.

```{r echo=FALSE}

# ________________ FILL IN PROJECT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION __________________

# Replace this chunk with an interpretation of the results - does the proposed project area look like it could generate carbon finance?

```

### Evidence from existing REDD+ projects

E-Ping Rau has conducted an analysis (currently unpublished) on existing REDD+ projects to determine the likely risks associated with our method of calculating anticipated additionality. This analysis quantifies the **overcrediting risk** - the risk of the observed additionality being lower than the anticipated additionality. From a sample of 13 existing REDD+ projects, we find that most projects have an overcrediting risk between 20% and 40% across all mitigation scenarios, though the overcrediting risk increases depending on the mitigation threshold chosen. The results are summarised in the graph below.

![Results of E-Ping's analysis](./images/eping_graph.png){width=75%}

\

Another analysis on a sample of 17 existing REDD+ projects shows that, on average, **projects were able to mitigate 34% of the deforestation that occurred in the business-as-usual scenario.**

### Recommendation for ex-post impact assessment

The intended purpose of the ex-ante baseline is solely to provide an estimate of the anticipated additionality, and the 4C team does not recommend that the baseline be used as the counterfactual against which future within-project deforestation is compared. Instead, we advocate for ex-post (after-the-fact) impact evaluation relative to a statistically matched, dynamic counterfactual. This ensures that any counfounding factors which drive up deforestation at a regional level after the project start are accounted for in the calculation of additionality.

### Statement on leakage and permanence

Leakage and impermanence are two factors that are likely to reduce the emissions reductions contributed by a project but **have not been included in this evaluation**.

**Leakage** is the displacement of activities which deplete forest carbon stocks from the project to other areas due to the implementation of the project. In the worst case scenario, 100% of these activities are displaced, effectively nullifying the additionality of the project. Leakage can be reduced by interventions which remove the incentive to continue activities which deplete forest carbon stocks in areas outside of the project.

**Impermanence** is the tendency of stored carbon to return to the atmosphere, and depends upon the ability of projects to protect their carbon stocks. Carbon stored in forests is inherently impermanent, given the finite lifespan of trees and the potential for deforestation and catastrophic events such as wildfires. The estimates given in this evaluation assume that all carbon stored is permanent, but in reality this is unlikely to be the case.

You can find out more about our future plans to deal with leakage and permanence in our [explainer page](https://4c.cst.cam.ac.uk/about/additionality-leakage-and-permanence).

# Appendix 1: matching variables

The full list of matching variables is given below:

-   Ecoregion

-   Country

-   Inaccessibility (motorized travel time to healthcare, minutes)

-   Slope ($^\circ$)

-   Elevation (meters)

-   Forest cover at t0 (project start, %)

-   Deforestation at t0 (%)

-   Forest cover at t-5 (5 years prior to project start, %)

-   Deforestation at t-5 (%)

-   Forest cover at t-10 (10 years prior to project start, %)

-   Deforestation at t-10 (%)

Forest cover and deforestation are measured as the proportion of pixels within a 1km radius of a particular point which are classified either as undisturbed forest (in the case of forest cover) or deforested (in the case of deforestation) by the JRC Tropical Moist Forest dataset.
